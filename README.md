### Hi there ðŸ‘‹! My name is Jacob Biehler

I'm a software engineer based out of San Diego, CA. I enjoy working with Open Source Software and want to begin contributing to more projects, if you know any good starter issues feel free to send me an [email](mailto:jacob@biehlerj.xyz). I currently work with Typescript, Java, Python, C++ and Docker and I'm beginning to learn Go.

Besides programming and learning new technologies I enjoy going hiking and camping in my local area, watching anime, and playing World of Warcraft Classic. You can check out what anime I'm watching and what manga I'm reading on my [AniList](https://anilist.co/user/LordlyHungryBear/).

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-biehler-475573139/) or at my [website](https://www.biehlerj.xyz).
