I'm a software engineer based out of sunny Arizona and am currently looking for a job. I enjoy working with Open Source Software and want to begin contributing to more projects, if you know any good starter issues feel free to send me an [email](mailto:jacob@biehlerj.xyz). I currently work with Typescript, Java, Python, and Docker and I'm beginning to learn Rust.

Besides programming and learning new technologies I enjoy going hiking and camping in my local area, watching anime, and playing video games. You can check out what anime I'm watching and what manga I'm reading on my [AniList](https://anilist.co/user/LordlyHungryBear/). I enjoy playing League of Legends, Valorant, Lost Ark, and many more.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-biehler-475573139/) or at my [website](https://www.biehlerj.xyz).
